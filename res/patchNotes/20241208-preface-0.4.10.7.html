	This is just a small hotfix to address two annoying bugs; one where the 'sleeping' status effect would often get stuck on you after sleeping, and one where demons were affected by menopause.
</p>
<p>
	Over the next two weeks I'm going to be splitting my focus between getting the wiki fixed and adding a small amount of new content. As this hotfix took a little longer to get released than I expected, I'm now aiming to get a preview version out before Christmas and then a full public release out by the end of December.
</p>
<p>
	Thank you all so much once again for your support and patience, and I'll see you again in the next update!
