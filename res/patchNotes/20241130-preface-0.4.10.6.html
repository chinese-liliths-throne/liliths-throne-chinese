	<i><b>Update from 0.4.10.5:</b> There was a bad game-breaking bug where interacting with demonic taurs would break the game. I've done an emergency hotfix to address this issue, which is why this version is now 0.4.10.6!</i>
</p>
<p>
	This version is focused on fixing bugs and making minor improvements to existing content. I've also merged a lot of pull requests from github, so thank you very much to all of the contributors on there!
</p>
<p>
	I'm going to continue to focus on fixing bugs and merging PRs over the next week, and I'm also going to (finally) work on getting the wiki restored. There will be another preview release out in about 2 weeks, which will include the aforementioned bugfixes and PR merges, as well as some new content. After that, I'll add more content for a public release which will be out before Christmas.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, thank you all once again so much for your support and patience, and I'll see you again in the next update!
