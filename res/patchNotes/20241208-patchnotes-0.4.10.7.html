<h2>v0.4.10.7</h2>

<h3>Contributors:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Enhancement: Add sybaritic potion (refractory potion), which increases the drinker's desired orgasms by 3-5 when consumed during sex, otherwise provides 1-4 essences. (PR#1829 by CognitiveMist)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where a dildo would be treated like a real penis and cause clothing to get dirty when orgasming. (PR#1820 by alfadorfox)</li>
	<li>Filled in some missing parsing. (PR#1780 by MintyChip)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Engine/Modding:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Moved the 'hyena' colour from the base res folder to the mod folder to conform with the location of the rest of the hyena-related files.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If you have bad ends turned off in your content settings, you will no longer encounter a bad end in the new side quest content.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Slaves:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Slaves who have permission to clean themselves will now only do so if they're not at work, or at a work type which allows cleaning (the jobs which do not allow cleaning are 'test subject', 'statue', 'public fucktoy', and 'dairy cow').</li>
	<li>Added a new cleanliness permission, 'Remove Odours', which will make the slave remove musky odours when they wash themselves.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sex:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added three new sadistic sex actions: 'Slap pussy', 'Pinch clit', and 'Slap cock'. (These actions are only available to characters with the 'sadist' fetish.)</li>
	<li>Virginity loss scenes now take into account whether your partner is asleep.</li>
	<li>When having sleep sex, you can no longer tell your partner to grow a cock, offer/request different areas, nor grant/revoke permissions.</li>
	<li>Added check for sleeping partner in the 'Deny' action.</li>
	<li>Added a new 'locked in stocks' immobilisation type, which is applied to the character being locked into stocks in all stocks-based sex scenes.</li>
	<li>Penetration-on-penetration ongoing sex actions (such as handjob reactions) are now available during immobilisation sex.</li>
	<li>Added more checks for a mute character in orgasm actions.</li>
	<li>Added description variation for resisting characters who request their partner to pull out.</li>
	<li>In the 'Orgasms' status effect tooltip, you can now see how many orgasms your character requires in sex to be satisfied. While this doesn't have an impact after sex, your consensual partners will want to satisfy you before ending sex, so the information is relevant for that.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Properly centre-aligned the icons for the 'elemental striker' and 'elemental defender' perks and significantly increased their effects.</li>
	<li>When viewing the tooltip for interacting with a missing slave, it will now say if they're in a slave lounge instead of erroneously saying that they're out at work.</li>
	<li>Improved tooltip description for racial books.</li>
	<li>When you free the slaves in the stocks in Slaver Alley, a new group of slaves will appear after ~6 hours have passed, instead of at midnight.</li>
	<li>Ingesting fluids in the milking room now passes 5 minutes of time instead of 1 hour.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Typo, parsing, and formatting fixes.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where demons were being affected by menopause.</li>
	<li>If you have anal/foot/armpit content disabled, the associated fetish preferences are no longer displayed during character creation.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where your character could sometimes end up with the 'sleeping' or 'heavily sleeping' status effects stuck on you after sleeping.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where starting double penetration would first stop the other ongoing penis-vagina action, resulting in a simple swap of who was penetrating the vagina (and throwing some parsing errors) instead of resulting in a double penetration.</li>
	<li>The 'Spawn attacker' function of the debug menu now correctly spawns the NPC as the race stage you select, instead of always spawning them as the 'lesser' stage.</li>
	<li>You can no longer equip sex toys during Rose's domination scene (while you're locked in stocks).</li>
	<li>Fixed bug in slaves' job management, where the 'Office' job had all of its hourly spots grayed out when it reached capacity, unlike all other jobs which kept the slots visible.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug in feral sex scenes where NPCs could generate sex preferences that involved breasts or fingers even if the feral target had no breasts nor fingers.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where all pierced areas would be reset when using the debug menu's 'race resets' or choosing to transform into a horse-girl for Sterope.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where if a weapon had all 5 damage types available, then it would break the formatting when viewing the weapons page in the encyclopedia.</li>
	<li>If getting transformed into a doll as a demon, you no longer keep your wings/tail/horns.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where when you leaded a saved game, all characters regained all of their default modifiers for all penetration and orifice types (penis, vagina, urethra, clit, anus, spinneret, nipples, crotch-nipples, mouth, tongue) instead of only the ones they had when the game was saved.</li>
	<li>After being transformed into a demon by Lyssieth, she will now be listed as your mother in her character details page, and in Elizabeth's details she will now be listed as your half-sister.</li>
	<li>Fixed minor issue with tooltip formatting for some items.</li>
</ul>
