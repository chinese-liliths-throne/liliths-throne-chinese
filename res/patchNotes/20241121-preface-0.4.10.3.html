	The main addition in this release is a new side quest focused around the sex shop, Lovienne's Luxuries. This new quest can be started after proceeding to the current end point of the main quest, and then meeting with the SWORD Enforcers in Elis's Enforcer station and asking them about the diary. This side quest includes a new location, a bad end, and a choice of two different resolutions which give different rewards. It also includes some post-quest content (which differs based on how you ended the quest) which involves the characters which appear in the quest. In total its scenes have about 85k words and there's also a lot of associated scripting which was created for it. I'll try not to get so focused on side quests in the future, as I think I ended up giving this one a disproportionate amount of content which contributed to, but was not completely responsible for, this version's delay.

	I've also made several more changes and fixed some things here and there, the details of which can be found in the patch notes. There's also some new artwork of Wes and Elle, which was drawn by Davyn. I'll try to get another artwork poll up for supporters on SubscribeStar soon after this release.

	Thank you so much for your support and patience, and I'm sorry about how long it took me to get this update released. The delay was partially due to adding so much content for this side quest, but it was mostly due to some personal issues which I've been experiencing this year. I'll now move on to fixing bugs and will hopefully have another update released in a week or so.
